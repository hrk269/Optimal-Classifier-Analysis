#	Used scikit learn in Python to implement different supervised learning algorithms and to develop machine learning classifiers for different sets of data
#	Repeated test data classification on a K-Nearest Neighbors Model, a Support Vector Machine/Classifier, and a Multi-layer Perceptron/Neural Network
#	Performed parameter tuning on all models while testing to build optimal classifiers  
#	Evaluated performance with metrics including accuracy, true positive rate, and true negative rate
#	Assigned classifiers to datasets based on results of evaluation metrics
